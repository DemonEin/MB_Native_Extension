#From DemonEinstein: copy this file to the Module_system 1.171 folder and change export_dir before attempting to build
#This is what I use, for example



# Point export_dir to the folder you will be keeping your module
# Make sure you use forward slashes (/) and NOT backward slashes (\)



export_dir = "H:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MountBlade Warband/Modules/Mod 1/"
#export_dir = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Mount&Blade Warband/Modules/Native/"
